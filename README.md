# Computer_Science - My Strava Analysis

## Description
This project aims to import my running data from my Strava account for analysis. The analysis will be divided into several objectives:
- Importing my running and weather data and storing it in the correct format
- Determining key factors that influence speed and fatigue
- Making performance predictions and comparing prediction models (physiological vs machine learning)
- Evaluating overtraining
